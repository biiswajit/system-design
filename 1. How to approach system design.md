Here's how you can approach a system design:

#### @Step 1: Understand the problem statement

Spend time on ==understanding the problem== and also figure out ==a rough number of people will use the product==. Once you design the system ==never over engineer and under engineer== the product.

#### @Step 2: Brake down the problem into high-level components

Figure out what are the high-level components you ==must required== for your system. ==Never add random components== if not need. Components are noting but ==features==.

```text
System design for facebook

			 |----------- auth
facebook ----|------------------- notification
			 |----------- feed
```

#### @Step 3: Dissect the components recursively

Once you know all the components you must need, ==dissect them==.

```text
Dissecting feed compoennt

webservers <---------------> databse <------------- aggregator
                               ^
                               |
                               |
                          generators
```

If you are not sure what `aggregator` will do, them remove it. Add into your design if it is ==absolutely necessary== and you have ==no doubt== about the component.

At this point when you know that you've gone into enough depth designing each components, you then move to next step.

#### @Step 4: Go technical

At this point you think like an developer and understand ==what tech== you should use to build the sub-components.

For each sub-components look for
- [] ==Database and caching==
Figure out what database you should use ?
Do you need caching ? if yes then where to put the cache and what data cache will store and for how long ?
What cache you gonna use ?

- [] ==Scaling and fault tolerance==
Figure out how to scale the sub-component if sudden spike happens ?
How you are going to balance the load ?
What happens if there is a sudden crash ?
How to handle the crash ?
How to recover from the crash ?

- [] ==Asynchronous processing==
Is there any tasks you can delegate ?
How to delegate the tasks ?
Do you need to batch the tasks ?

- [] ==Communications==
How one component will talk to another ?
What communication method they are gonna use ? WebSockets, TCP, UDP, WebRTC, gRPC etc ?

#### @Step 5: Can you spit the sub-components even further ?

This is optional for look for each sub-components that you've designed can think ==can you divide them in more depth== ?

   post service              recommandation service
			    \          /
			     \>      </
webserver <----->  mamager  <------ follow service 
					^
					|
					v
				feed internal databse
```

>Tips
>If you are understanding or designing a big problem then start with ==top-to-down== approach
>If you are understanding or designing a small problem then start with ==bottom-to-up== approach

## How do you know that you've built a good system ?

Asks these questions to yourself...

#### Have you broken down your system into components ?

A good designed system must have multiple component doing their job. If you have multiple components then congrats you've passed the first check.

Dissecting feed compoennt

webservers <---------------> databse <------------- aggregator
                               ^
                               |
                               |
                          generators
```

#### Are components have their own set of responsibilities ?

All components must do their own job, they must not interfere with components job. Also you have to make sure that not two different components doing same jobs. 

```text
webservers: fetching feeds from feed database and serving them to users
generators: generating feeds from multiple services and stoting into database
aggregator: filtering unrelavent feeds from database
```

#### Have you chosen right tech stack to build components ?

Are all components are rightly implemented into code ? You need to make sure the technologies you've chosen to build the system is well suited and you did not over-engineered and under-engineered.

#### Are components scale-able, fault tolerant, available ?
