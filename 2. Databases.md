## Relational databases
One of key offerings of relational databases is `transactions`. It follows the `ACID` properties.

#### Atomicity (the A)
If there are multiple related, depended operations has to be executed in one go the Atomicity property ensures that either all of these operations will execute or none of them will execute.

```text
Start
	Operation 1
	Operation 2
	...
	Operation N
Commit
```

Before `commit` if any of these operation fails (due to any reason) the entire transaction will fail.

#### Consistency (the C)
Consistency as the name suggests ensures that your database always remains in a consistent state (before making any changes and after making any changes).

```text
Conststent state of your database (before)
Some operation happens
Consistent state of your database (after)
```

Relational database provides `constraints`, `cascase`, `triggers` to maintain consistency in your database.

#### Isolation (the I)
If there are two concurrent transactions are happening at a exactly same time and both are working on same data from database. How much transparency both of these transactions will get over that shared data.

```text
Transaction 1                    Transaction 2
--------------------------------------------------
READ(X)                          
WRITE(X) *conflicting            READ(X)
READ(X)                          READ(X) *conflicting
```

What to do with this shared statement ?
Four strategies : `read uncommitted`, `read committed`, `repeatable read`, `serializable`. 
Next one is more stricter than the previous one.

##### Read uncommitted
Your transaction can read all updated changes made by some other uncommitted transaction.
```mysql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED; # setting the strategy
SELECT @@tranaction_ISOLATION; # verify the isolation level
START TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM "User"; # if there any other transaction made any changes to "User" table but yet committed. still here you will see the updated value
COMMIT;
```

##### Read committed
Your transaction will read all updated changes made by some other committed transaction.
```mysql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED; # setting the strategy
SELECT @@tranaction_ISOLATION; # verify the isolation level
START TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM "User"; # if there any other transaction made any changes to "User" table and committed then only ere you will see the updated value
COMMIT;
```

##### Repeatable read (default one)
You get a consistent view over the data throughout the transaction even though there are some other transactions (either committed or uncommitted) made an changes over your data.
```mysql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
SELECT @@transaction_ISOLATION;
START TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM "User"; 
SELECT * FROM "User"; # you'll get the same output no matter what
COMMIT;
```

##### Serializable
The strictest one. Here your transaction can not even access the data if there are other transaction started working on the same data and your operation conflicting with the other transaction. 
What happens ? Your transaction waits until the other one `commit` or `rollback`. Once the other transaction finish you receive the updated data.
```mysql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
SELECT @@transaction_ISOLATION;
START TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM "User"; # waits if there other transaction working with "User" table
COMMIT;
```
#### Durability (the D)
Once one operation is in `commit` state then no matter what the will remains on the disk.

## How to vertically scale databases ?
Increase the capacity of the machine.
Drawback is that you can not scale bound a point.

## How to horizontally scale databases ?
Instead of having one big machine have multiple machines.
#### Read replication
In day-to-day scenario most of the cases your database receives more reads than write. In this this kind of scenario the replication works well.

Create a master database that supports both the read and writes.
Create slave databases that supports only the reads.
When a request comes to API service the API server then maps the request to master (for write request) and slave (for read request).

Problem ?
If mater is performing writes how to does the saves get all the updated values ?

Solution ?
##### Synchronous update of slave
When a write request comes you write into both the master as well as slave databases.
```text
1. Write request comes to API server.
2. API server writes into Mater databse
3. API server writes into Slave databases
4. When both writes are done send acknowledgement to user
```
Pros :
Both the databases are going to be very consistent about their data.

Cons:
Very slow writes.

##### Asynchronous update of slave
When a write request comes you update the master database only. Salve databases time to time update themselves from master.
```text
1. Write request comes to API server.
2. API server writes into Master database
3. API server sends acknowledgement to user
```

Slave database
```text
1. In some interval of time
2. Check for any update from master database
3. Update themselves
4. Again repeat
```
Pros:
Faster write operation.

Cons:
Data inconsistency among both the databases.

#### Sharding
> `Shards` are noting but database services. If you have 3 database services for your system then it means you have 3 shards.

> `Partiions` are noting but subset of your database data. Suppose you have total 100GB of data and you split into 70GB and 30GB then these spitted data is known as partitions.

Partitions can be created two ways:

Horizontally: Split by `rows`
Suppose you have 1000 rows in your table, you split them and created two partitions both having 500 rows each.

Vertically: Split by `columns`
Suppose your table has 100 columns, you make two partitions and both of these partitions are having 50 columns each.

You can combine sharing and partitioning to handle scale up your database horizontally.

## Non-relational databases

A type of database that store data in other format (graph, key-value store, object format etc) than row and column fashion.
Non-relational databases shards really well out of the box.
There are many non-relational databases out there - 

#### Document databases
These databases store data in object-like format. In document based databases you can run complex queries similar to SQL databases. The big advantage is that they support partial updates of any object.
suppose - 
```json
{
"name": "Biswajit Malakar",
"email": "mebiswajitmalakar@gmail.com",
"likes": 30
}
```
now if you want just to update the number of like, you can do that without copying the entire object to the server, so it requires little bandwidth than relational databases.
example of document based databases are - MongoDB, Elasticsearch
can be used for - in-app notifications, catalog services etc

#### Key-value storage
These databases store data in key-value format. where each value will have a key and you can use the key to retrieve the value. They support limited functionality not for complex queries. Easy to make partitions and shards.
```python
"name" = "Biswajit"
"email" = "mebiswajitmalakar"
"likes" = 30
```
some examples are - Redis, DynamoDB, Aerospike.
most common use cases are - message storage, user profile info, auth data etc

#### Graph database
Just like a graph, and you can do whatever you can do with graph. Very specific to some use cases like social media, recommendation system etc.
example of graph databases are - Neo4j, Neptune, DGraph etc
