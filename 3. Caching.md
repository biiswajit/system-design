A cache is a very much faster yet expensive storage where you store the data that is going to be used very frequently. In this technique you are saving a lot of database access and network access.
You always try to store the case in logically close to API server to to provide the data much faster.

```text
user <------------> API server <-------------> database
                        ^
                        |
                      cache
```

Where cache store the data ?
Cache can can store the data anywhere with faster access time than database. It can be primary memory, or a dedicated memory or within the API server okay you get the idea.

What data should i store in the cache ?
You store the data is going to be used very frequently in near future. You do not store all the data but only the essentials since cache storage are expensive.
Some example maybe - authentication token, latest posts in social media, latest messages in a group messaging application.
When you store data in a cache you always set Time-To-Live so that data get automatically deleted.

Because of cache you may serve your user stale data.

Some example of cache service are Redis, Memcached etc


## How to populate the cache ?
There are two primary ways to populate data into cache.

#### Lazy population
In this approach you don't populate a data until you get a cache miss for that data. Once you get a cache miss then you store the data from database to cache.
```text
IF data in cache:
	RETURN the data from cache
ELSE:
	GET the data from database
	STORE the data into cache
	RETURN data from cache
```

#### Eager population 
In this approach you store the data into cache before a cache miss. Even when first time you are requesting for the data you get it from the cache.

How do you handle write in this case ?
When you get a new data to store into database you concurrently store the data in cache as well. Reads always happens from cache. In case of write you write in both the places.
```text
IF a very popular celebrety post something:
	STORE the post into the cache
	STORE the post into the database
```

## How do you scale a cache ?
Cache is like a storage so you can scale the cache just like how you can scale a database

----

## Different levels of cache
You can setup cache in different levels. It is a trade off sure you will get much quicker response but you will get stale data. So it is very important to know what to cache and what not to cache.

#### Client side caching
So you can cache static data in browser. It is not suggested to cache dynamic data into a browser but static data like images, scripts, etc. Always set expiry for the data you're caching.
[Here](https://medium.com/@steelcityamir/a-web-developers-guide-to-browser-caching-cc41f3b73e7c) is a blog about caching data in browser.

#### Content Delivery Network
CDNs are a set of servers that are distributed across the world. When an user make a request, the CDN network will route the request through the nearest CDN server configured hence user will get must faster response. Again not recommended for dynamic content or for data that are changing very frequently but for data that are static.
```text
Browser <-----> CDN server <------> Origin server
```

Cloudflare, Akamai are some popular CDN servers.

#### Remote caching
Typical caching layer between the API server and the database.
```text
Client <------> API server <-----> Cache <-----> Database
```

#### Database caching
In database caching you store values that typically requires calculation. For example in social media you get a option to see how many followers you have. Storing this information into remote cache or in CDN or in client does not make sense. The solution is create a new table in database to store the calculation and where there is a change in followers you change the calculation as well.
```text
UserId       | followerCount
